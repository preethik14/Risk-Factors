# Risk-Factors
Computation of risk factors for lung diseases involves analyzing various demographic, environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing specific lung conditions. We have incorporated patient's demographic data into consideration for calculating the disease risk factors. The demographic data is obtained from ICBHI dataset and the annotated lung sound and diseases.
